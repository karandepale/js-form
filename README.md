FORM VALIDATION IN JAVA SCRIPT 
LINK:-https://splendorous-wisp-52763c.netlify.app/

Web forms are used to collect user's information such as name, email address, location, age, 
and so on. But sometimes users do not enter the expected details. So it is crucial to validate the form data before sending it to the server-side. 
For form validation, client-side JavaScript can help us.

js form validation is used to reduces the number of request to the server , because the java script checks the conditions on the browser .

Form validation checks the accuracy of the userâ€™s information before submitting the form. 
JavaScript provides faster client-side form validation than server-side validation does.
Server-side validation requires more time first occurring on the server,
which requires the user's input to be submitted and sent to the server before validation occurs.
Thus, client-side validation helps to create a better user experience.
